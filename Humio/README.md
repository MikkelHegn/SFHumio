# Humio

TODO:

Write basic directions 1 - 2 - 3 to capture getting started with Humio. Probably just reference public docs.

Make sure reader is familiar with repositories and ingest tokens!

Next, head up to https://cloud.humio.com and create a free account. Alternatively, you can run Humio on your own hardware. See https://docs.humio.com/installation/.
